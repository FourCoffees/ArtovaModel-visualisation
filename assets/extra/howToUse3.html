<h2>How To Use</h2>
<p> Artova Model is based on Artovaâ€™s six years experience and six Spirit of Artova -project groups works.
 Here you will find all the information gathered and analysed on these projects. </p>

<p> Each project has also been represented by the ArtovaModel, by measuring the frequency of some type of events
over others. So in this overview we see that "My House Arabia" has been dealing with "Personal Resources" issues more than 
the "Arabia Street Festival".</p>

<p>Also, these events have been included as a timeline for each project. 
Notice their motivation variate through time depending on the event as well as the overall levels of the group! </p>
