[{"Abrev":"ea","Name":"Edible Arabia","Description":"Edible Arabianranta is an environmental artwork cultivated by Arabianranta residents. It offers a fresh method of cultivating in a city in a way that fulfils the aesthetic expectations for agriculture in city-centre. Thus far, all the plots of land reserved for the city people to cultivate have been simple square-shaped patches. The environmental artwork by the students of Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture demonstrates that empty plots in central urban areas can be harnessed with style to serve as a source of joy, as well as of greens and vegetables. The concept can be realized anywhere in the world because the seedlings will grow in boxes, which means that polluted earth wonâ€™t be an obstacle to the cultivation. Edible Arabiaranta was carried out by the residents with students of Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, the Helsinki City Real Estate Department and Artova.\n","TeamNo":6,"TeamQua":null,"Team":null,"DesignersNo":3,"Designers":"and 4 designer students (art coordinator, environmental artist, and architects)","Budget":3800,"ScheduledBudget":8000,"ParticipantsNo":"around 30 ","Participants":null,"PartnersNo":11,"Partners":"Fiskars, Arabic Service, HSY, Stara, Helsinki Economic and Planning, Real Estate Department, Aalto University - environmental art, L & T, Dodo, Branch River Sawmill, University of Helsinki botanical Garden","MediaNo":10,"Media":"Helsinki messages, StadiTV, at news, Neighborhood, Metro Station, Consortium, Food Information, Kuohu, Mingpao weekly, kaupunkiviljely.fi","Also":"30 growing boxes","Img":"ea","DosDonts":null}]
