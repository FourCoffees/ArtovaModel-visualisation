[{"Abrev":"ddp","Name":"Design Dog Park","Description":"Design Dog Park is a project aiming to build an enclosure for dogs in a Helsinki neighborhood (Arabianranta-Toukola-Vanhakaupunki) that also people can enjoy. We’re creating a dog park that strengthens the design-oriented spirit of the eastern inner city and attracts international attention. The dog park will be a source of new models of co-operation for the residents and visitors of the Artova area, the Helsinki city officials working in city planning, students of design, dog societies and commercial parties. The dog park is a place where dogs and their owners walk, meet and enjoy themselves. The design element extends the function of the place to reach out also to those who don’t have a dog. Design Dog Park makes it possible to apply functional design to a new kind of environment and thus supports the coming-about of new services and innovation.","TeamNo":8,"TeamQua":null,"Team":null,"DesignersNo":6,"Designers":"architects, interior architects, mobile 3D teacher and the student, the design student","Budget":242,"ScheduledBudget":75000,"ParticipantsNo":300,"Participants":null,"PartnersNo":6,"Partners":"Vireko, Neroko, Royal Canin, Pedigree, HKI kaupunkisuunittelu and Reconstruction","MediaNo":3,"Media":"Helsingin Sanomat , Dog magazine, YLE time","Also":"4 events (eg snow dog park) ","Img":"ddp","DosDonts":"http://www.artovanhenki.fi/dos-and-donts/"}]
