[{"Abrev":"mha","Name":"My House Arabia","Description":"My House Arabianranta is introducing local buildings and their journey from a paper draft and artistic idea into the everyday life of the inhabitants. The aim is to spread knowledge of how blocks of flats are built, what factors affect the local architecture and how the Percent for Art scheme, for example, is followed when planning works of art. The discussions and exchanges of experiences can also be used when constructing other new districts. My House Arabianranta is a concept which is transferable to any house in Finland or elsewhere.","TeamNo":90,"TeamQua": "residents","Team":"and 20 more actives","DesignersNo":15,"Designers":"architects, artist plus a graphic designer","Budget":"5313.52","ScheduledBudget":6945,"ParticipantsNo":250,"Participants":"free for all","PartnersNo":20,"Partners":"Design Week, Open House Helsinki, ATT, Skanska, Fiskars, Hoas, Metropolia Urbani creativity project, the M-Shop, Helsinki, coffee roasters, Vallila Interior, Dylan, Arabic, Recycling Center, Frimodig frame, Presence, the Arabian hometown of paths, K-supermarket Arabian Beach, Divarikopi, City Centre Campus, Toukola Village Health Association, Turning Place, the Magic Lantern","MediaNo":4,"Media":"StadiTV, Radio Finland, Demon Stone magazine, Kuohu Journal","Also":" Nearly 20 other program issues (including concerts, workshops, exhibitions, pop-up cafes) and 30 performers or leaders","Img":"mha.jpg","DosDonts":"http://www.google.com"}]
