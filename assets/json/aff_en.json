[{"Abrev":"aff","Name":"Artova Film Festival","Description":"Artova Film Festival has created the concept of regional film festivals. AFF is the joyful collision of professionals of the industry, students and staff of some of the local schools (Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Department of Motion Picture, Television and Production Design; Arcada, Metropolia and Helsinki Pop & Jazz Conservatory) and audience from near and far. AFF is also a place where a film festival is developed further as a service for film-makers, and the focus is shifted from technique to content and soft values.","TeamNo":17,"TeamQua":null,"Team":"producers, publicists, filmmakers, residents and students","DesignersNo":4,"Designers":"an interior designer, graphic designer and illustrator","Budget":5714,"ScheduledBudget":32250,"ParticipantsNo":1200,"Participants":"visitors","PartnersNo":24,"Partners":"Helsinki International Film Festifal, Helsinki short film festival, the movie Contact, Arcada, P.
